# calculator
The calculator is probably one of the most common project ideas that you will see in many youtube videos. And the reason for this is that it is
very easy to make and it will clear your basic concepts regarding
if-else statements and while loop.

The calculator will start by asking what the user wants to do, like:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division, and

Exit

Based on the option, the script will either add, subtract, multiply or
divide the numbers that the user entered. Once the operation is
complete, the script will again ask the user its choice. If the user
chooses to exit, the program will stop.
